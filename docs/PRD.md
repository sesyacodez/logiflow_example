# PRD: LogiFlow AI – Dynamic Logistics Optimization System

## 1. Product Vision
**LogiFlow AI** is an intelligent resource management platform designed to solve the problem of rigid supply chains. It enables logistics companies to re-route and re-allocate resources (fuel, goods, supplies) in real-time based on fluctuating demand, ensuring that critical needs are met first.

---

## 2. Target Audience
* **Logistics Dispatchers:** Need a bird's-eye view of the supply chain to approve re-calculations.
* **Warehouse Operators:** Need a simple, rugged interface to manage outgoing stock.
* **Point-of-Delivery Managers:** Need to send "Urgent" requests when stock hits critical lows.

---

## 3. Problem Statement
Traditional logistics plans are static. If a "Point A" suddenly needs twice the fuel while a "Point B" has a surplus, current systems cannot easily divert the shipment mid-route. This leads to:
1.  **Stockouts** in high-demand areas.
2.  **Resource Waste** in low-demand areas.
3.  **Financial Losses** due to inefficient mileage.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 MVP (Core Features)
* **Live Inventory Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of stock levels across all delivery points.
* **Dynamic Re-calculation Engine:** An algorithm that suggests moving resources from "Low Priority/High Stock" points to "High Priority/Low Stock" points.
* **Tri-Level Prioritization:**
    * **Level 1 (Normal):** Routine replenishment.
    * **Level 2 (Elevated):** Stock will run out in < 6 hours.
    * **Level 3 (Critical):** Immediate stockout; operational stoppage.
* **Urgent Request Trigger:** A "One-Tap" button for managers to signal a crisis.
* **Data Security:** JWT-based authentication and encrypted payloads for sensitive resource data.

### 4.2 Innovation & Advanced Features (Bonus Points)
* **Offline-First Sync:** Using **Service Workers (PWA)** to allow warehouse staff to scan and confirm loads without a stable 4G/Wi-Fi connection.
* **P2P Resource Sharing:** A feature that shows the nearest *other* delivery point that has a surplus, allowing for local "borrowing" instead of waiting for the main warehouse.

---

## 5. Technical Stack (Proposed)
* **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js (Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsiveness).
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent data + Redis for real-time priority queues.
* **Logic:** A custom **Priority Weighting Algorithm**:
    $$Score = (DemandRatio \times PriorityMultiplier) + TimeSinceLastDelivery$$

---

## 6. User Experience (UX) Goals
* **Warehouse Usability:** High-contrast UI, large buttons for gloved hands, and barcode scanning support.
* **Clarity:** Use color coding (Red = Critical, Yellow = Warning, Green = OK) to minimize cognitive load for dispatchers.

---

## 7. Success Metrics (KPIs)
* **Re-allocation Speed:** System must calculate a new distribution plan in under 3 seconds.
* **Fulfillment Rate:** Increase the percentage of "Critical" requests met within the first 2 hours.
* **Connectivity Resilience:** Zero data loss during offline-to-online transitions.

---

## 8. Roadmap & Scalability
1.  **Phase 1:** Manual approval of re-calculations by a dispatcher (Current Hackathon Scope).
2.  **Phase 2:** AI-driven predictive demand (forecasting shortages before they happen).
3.  **Phase 3:** Autonomous vehicle/Drone integration for small-batch urgent deliveries.
